# Carol

Carol is a framework for making pixel art games in Go.

**Not yet in a usable state!**

This is a *work in progress*: The framework is *very* incomplete, and the API is not yet set in stone.

## License

The code is under a simplified BSD license (see LICENSE file). When a sub-package

## Credits

The Perlin and Simplex noise functions are adapted from
["Simplex Noise Demystified"](http://www.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/simplexnoise.pdf)
by Stefan Gustavson (code in the public domain).

The pixel font was originally based on ["Pixel Operator
Mono"](https://notabug.org/HarvettFox96/ttf-pixeloperator) by Jayvee Enayas, but
has been so modified that it's now a completely different font. It is still
licensed under the SIL OFL.
